1. Dependencies: Both "web_scraper.js" and "package.json" share dependencies. The "web_scraper.js" file will require certain npm packages to function, such as "axios" for making HTTP requests, "cheerio" for parsing HTML, and "fs" for file system operations. These dependencies will be listed in the "package.json" file.

2. Data Schema: The "web_scraper.js" and "scraped_data.json" files share a data schema. The JavaScript file will structure the scraped data in a specific format (e.g., an array of objects where each object represents a review and has properties for company profile, rating, likes, and dislikes), and this structured data will be stored in the JSON file.

3. DOM Element IDs: The "web_scraper.js" file will need to know the IDs of the DOM elements it's scraping from the G2 website. These might include elements for the reviewer's company profile, the rating, and the "What do you like best" and "What do you dislike" text fields.

4. Function Names: The "web_scraper.js" file will contain functions for scraping the data, handling pagination and dynamic content, and storing the data. These function names will be unique identifiers within the file.

5. Variable Names: The "web_scraper.js" file will use certain variable names to store and manipulate data. These might include variables for the scraped data, the current page number (for handling pagination), and any temporary variables used for processing.

6. JSON Keys: The keys used in the "scraped_data.json" file to store the scraped data will be shared with the "web_scraper.js" file, as the JavaScript file will need to know these keys to correctly structure the data.
